   Dental Crown and Bridge: are also used to protect and reshape teeth that have undergone major destruction and prevent complications.
   
   There is a wide variety of dental bridges. The type of bridge that is designed for a particular clinical situation depends on many factors such as geographical location, patient desires and financial situation, practitioner preferences etc.
   
   Although in the past years, dental implants tend to replace them, traditional dental bridges (supported by natural teeth) are still widespread throughout the world. <br><br><br> <br><br><br></p>

   Are your teeth and jaws positioned improperly? At green life specialty dental clinic we correct crooked teeth. If crooked teeth not straightened and treated, it will be difficult to clean exposing your teeth to decay. We make sure you have healthy and beautiful teeth.
   Invisalign
   straightens your teeth without wires and brackets, using a series of clear, customized, removable appliances called aligners. It’s virtually undetectable, which means hardly anyone will know that you’re straightening your teeth.The Invisalign System combines advanced 3-D computer graphics technology with 100-year-old science of orthodontics. Invisalign aligners are designed to move your teeth in small steps to the desired final position prescribed by your orthodontist. Each aligner is precisely calibrated and manufactured to fit your mouth at each stage of the treatment plan. Your first step is to visit our office to determine if Invisalign is right for you. After sending precise treatment instructions, Invisalign uses advanced computer technology to translate these instructions in a sequence of finely calibrated aligners – as few as 12 or as many as 48. Each aligner is worn for about two weeks and only taken out to eat, brush and floss. As you replace each aligner with the next, your teeth will begin to move gradually – week-by-week until the final alignment prescribed is attained. Then you’ll be smiling like you never have before!To ensure the best possible results, only an orthodontist who has been trained and certified by Align Technology can diagnose and treat using Invisalign. Invisalign is not intended for children and is not appropriate for every adult. Only an orthodontist can determine if this treatment is an effective option for you.
